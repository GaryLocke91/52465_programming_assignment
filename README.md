This Jupyter Notebook concerns the ```numpy.random``` package in Python. It explains the overall purpose of the package, the use of simple random data functions, permutations functions, and includes a detailed explanation of eight distributions provided for in the package. The final section explains the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers. 

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

#### 1. Purpose of the package

#### 2. Simple random data functions
   
- 2.1 integers()
- 2.2 random()
- 2.3 choice()
- 2.4 bytes()
   
#### 3. Permutations functions
  
- 3.1 shuffle()
- 3.2 permutation()
   
#### 4. Distributions functions
  
- 4.1 chisquare()
- 4.2 exponential()
- 4.3 geometric()
- 4.4 normal()
- 4.5 rayleigh()
- 4.6 standard_t()
- 4.7 triangular()
- 4.8 uniform()

#### 5. Seeds

#### 6. References

### Executing the Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook can be installed either from the [main website](https://jupyter.org/) or as part of the [Anaconda Open Source Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Jupyter is a Python package designed to make it easier to interact with Python.

1. Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, download the notebook to a folder on your computer.

2. Open the command line and browse to the folder the notebook was downloaded to using the ```cd``` command to change directory.

3. Type ```jupyter notebook``` and press ENTER.

4. It automatically opens a tab in your default browser.

5. Click on *52465_programming_assignment.ipynb* to open the notebook.

To run a code cell in the notebook, click onto the cell, hold down the CTRL key and press ENTER. 

It is recommended that each cell is run sequentially from the beginning to the end of the notebook, as some are depended on the imported librares and/or variables created in the preceding block. Alternatively, all cells can be run at once by clicking *Cell* from the menu bar and clicking *Run All* from the drop-down menu.  

To restart the kernel and clear all created output, click *Kernel* from the menu bar and click *Restart & Clear Output*.

When you have finished viewing the notebook, close the web browser and return to the command line.

Hold down the CTRL key and press C to terminate the programme.
