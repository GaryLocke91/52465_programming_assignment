    "***\n",
    "NumPy is a high-performance multidimensional array library and is the core library for scientific computing in Python. A NumPy array is a grid of values of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. The standard Python library provides lists, which is the Python equivalent of a NumPy array, but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types. NumPy data structures perform better in terms of size, performance and functionality.<sup>1</sup> Although Python has an in-built ```random``` package, ```numpy.random``` is a subpackage of NumPy that offers a suite of extra functionality and methods based on pseudorandom number generation.<sup>2</sup> It contains some simple random data generation methods, permutation and distribution functions, and random generator functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about NumPy's ```ndarray``` objects relevant to the ```numpy.random``` module:\n",
    "- The data in an ```ndarray``` must be homogeneous\n",
    "- Arrays have a ```ndim``` attribute for the number of axes or dimensions of the array\n",
    "- Arrays have a ```shape``` attribute which is a tuple that indicates the size of the array in each dimension\n",
    "- Arrays have a ```dtype``` attribute which describes the data type of the array\n",
    "- The ```size``` attribute is the total number of elements in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "![NumPy Array](arrays.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A random number does not mean generating a different number each time, but rather something that cannot be logically predicted. If there is a computer programme that can generate a random number, it can be predicted, and therefore it is not truly random. Random numbers generated using an algorithm are referred to as \"pseudorandom numbers\".<sup>3</sup> Pseudorandomness is a sample of numbers that appear to be randomly generated, but were in fact generated using a deterministic process. They are generated in a sequence that is seeded with an initial number. Although the value of this seed is not important, what is important to note is that the same seeding of the process will result in the same sequence of random numbers.<sup>4</sup> An explanation of the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers will be given in section 5.\n",

In this particular example, the seed is set to 123. If no seed is passed, then fresh, unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS.<sup>5</sup> This infers that the seed will be based on the current time. The seed will be different each time the programme is run and consequently the sequence of random numbers will also be different with each run. The default BitGenerator used by Generator is PCG64, which will be discussed in more detail in section 5."

    "As illustrated in the image above, there are various shapes, models and classifications of probability distributions classified into two distinct categories: discrete and continuous. If a variable can take on any value between two specified values, it is continuous; otherwise, it is discrete.<sup>54</sup> There are 35 distribution functions in the ```numpy.random``` package. Eight of these are listed below and will be discussed in this section. With the exception of ```geometric()```, they are continuous distributions. A uniform distribution can be continuous or discrete.\n",

    "Each of the distribution functions generate different random numbers according to different probabilities over different intervals and can be used to simulate and understand data. Distribution plots are an ideal way of visualising these distributions. There are specific applications and uses for each type of distribution, but they can nearly all be related to each other or transformed into each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these distribution functions have a *size* parameter, which defines how many numbers to generate. This can be specified by either an integer or a tuple. Passing a tuple will result in an array filled with random numbers of a defined shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “empirical cumulative distribution function” (ECDF) is used to visualise and compare each distribution. In an ECDF, the x-axis corresponds to the range of values for variables and the y-axis shows the proportion of data points that are less than are equal to corresponding x-axis value.<sup>23</sup> The ECDF is useful as it approximates the true CDF well if the sample size is large, and knowing the distribution is helpful for statistical inference. The resulting plot can be visually compared to known CDFs to check if the data originated from one of those frequently used distributions. It can also illustrate “how fast” the CDF increases to 1.<sup>24</sup> It is useful to plot the ECDF first, as it shows all the data and gives a complete picture of how the data are distributed. A function is defined below to calculate the ECDF and will be applied throughout this section.<sup>23</sup>"

TRNGs are typically based on real-world phonomena such as thermal noise and radioactive decay, and are commonly used in cryptography. Although they produce non-deterministic number sequences, there are some disadvantages such as slowness and high cost. On the other hand, PRNGs produce deterministic number sequences based on a seed.<sup>53</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "A random seed is a number used to initialise a pseudorandom number generator. The number sequence of this generator is completely determined by the seed, and therefore if the generator is reinitialised with the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of numbers.<sup>48</sup> It can be considered a sequence of decisions made from a starting state following a particular strategy. According to Pasqualini and Parton (2020), a good pseudorandom number generator corresponds to a good strategy in a decision-making process.<sup>52</sup> $\\pi$ is a commonly used seed, as it has a decimal expansion that never repeats a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wolfram MathWorld<sup>60</sup>, a random number is\n",
    ">*a number chosen as if by chance from some specified distribution such that selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces the underlying distribution. Almost always, such numbers are also required to be independent, so that there are no correlations between successive numbers. Computer-generated random numbers are sometimes called pseudorandom numbers, while the term \"random\" is reserved for the output of unpredictable physical processes. When used without qualification, the word \"random\" usually means \"random with a uniform distribution.\" Other distributions are of course possible.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the superseded version of the package, the algorithm used to call random number generator functions, such as ```np.random.normal()```, was the Mersenne Twister. It has been a widely used and reliable means of random number generation. However, in the latest version (v1.19), the ```numpy.random``` module offers random number generators with better statistical performance than the legacy MT19937 used in ```RandomState```, with the default set to the PCG64 generator. By calling ```default_rng()```, a new instance of a Generator is obtained, providing access to a wide range of distributions.<sup>49</sup> The table below provides a summary of the comparison between the two algorithms.<sup>57</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "![PCG](pcg_compare.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "A permuted congruential generator (PCG) applies an output permutation function to improve the statistical properties of a modulo-$2^n$ linear congruential generator with small and fast code, and small state size. Linear congruential generators are one of the oldest and best-known PRNG algorithms. They are however known to be statistically weak, but since the PCG's state transition function only does half the work, it does not need to be perfect. The output function turns the generator's internal state into the actual random number. The PCG uses a new technique called permutation functions on tuples to produce output that is much more random than the PRNG's internal state. The output functions give a PCG it its excellent statistical performance. PCG64 is a 128-bit implementation of O'Neill's permuted congruential generator. It has a period of $2^{128}$ and supports advancing an arbitrary number of steps. Random variates are generated by permuting the output of a 128-bit LCG.<sup>50</sup> As PCG64 is a more sophisticated algorithm, it is clear why it is now the default random number generator in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate that random number generation is deterministic, the code below will explicitly seed the random number generator to 500 to illustrate that the same random numbers are generated. However, the sequence of numbers appears to lack any pattern, and therefore they can be considered random."
